# Quora question-pairing

## Description
This project was part of Natural Language Processing (NLP: CS 6120) under Prof. Ahmad Uzair in summer 2022.

### Problem statement
The problem is to find two sentences with similar meaning. There are lots of examples over the internet which require filtering the sentences based on uniqueness in the meaning. For instance, there could be many reviews or emails or text documents which involve restructuring of sentences and yet provide same meaning to it.
For this purpose, we found a dataset on Kaggle which provides information if two questions posted on quora have similar meaning or not. The set of labels that have been supplied by human experts. However, human labeling is a noisy process as people can have conflict on agreement. As a result, the labels on this dataset are taken as is but not 100% accurate.
